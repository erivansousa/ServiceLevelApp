# ServiceLevelApp

The application is a single page web application, it was developed using JavaScript powered by NodeJS.

## Getting Started

As it was developed with JavaScript the build process isn't necessary, you just need to download and install the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime, and clone or download the [project source code](https://github.com/erivansousa/ServiceLevelApp).

### Running

The starting point of the project is the file slapp.js in the project root directory, so, after you've installed the Nodejs runtime and downloaded the project source code, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project root directory and run the command:

```
node slapp.js
```
Or, if you're using the Nodemon utility:
```
nodemon slapp.js
```
